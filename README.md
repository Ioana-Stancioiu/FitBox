# FitBox

Counts your steps using an ADXL345 accelerometer while also keeping you updated  
on steps, calories and distance covered, by a bluetooth connection (HC-05 module)  
with an app on your phone.

## Setup

The project can be compiled and uploaded on your arduino board using the script  
upload.sh. Don't forget to change the PORT, BOARD and CPU (bootloader) variables  
to match your configuration.
